2018 Influenza Season Preparation

To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.

For this project we were provided data from the CDC and the US Census Bureau to plan for the 2018 Influenza Season. We used technical skills and soft skills to communicate insights to stakeholders as to what should be done to poractively plan for staffing needs across the country.
